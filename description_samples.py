     AI Receptionists: Your Ticket to SaaS Millions
        Agency owners, listen up. You're missing a goldmine: AI receptionists.
        Every business needs call handling. Traditional receptionists are expensive and limited. AI does it better, cheaper, 24/7. We've built the system. Now we need smart agency owners to resell it.
        Why you? You've got the clients. You're solving their marketing problems. This is another problem you can solve effortlessly.
        The math is simple:

        Pay us $54.99 per receptionist.
        Charge clients what you want. Many get $400+.
        We handle tech. You manage relationships.

        It's high-margin, scalable, and low-effort.
        The kicker? It's fully white-labeled. Your brand, your dashboard, your pricing.
        This isn't just another service. It's your springboard to a multi-million dollar SaaS business:

        Recurring revenue
        Sticky product
        Upsell potential
        Low churn

        We're not gouging you with white-label fees or revenue shares. Just the base cost. We win when you win.
        Starting is dead simple:

        Sign up
        Get your white-labeled dashboard
        Sell to existing clients

        No complex onboarding. No tech skills needed. Plug it in and watch recurring revenue grow.
        Support? Direct Slack channel with our founder. Fast answers. Regular 1:1 calls to boost your success.
        This is your path to a serious SaaS business, potentially dwarfing your current agency revenue.
        The AI revolution is now. Receptionists are just the beginning. Get in early, build your base, and ride the wave as AI transforms business.
        Don't overthink. Low cost, massive upside, ready market. Every business needs this. They just don't know it yet.
        Be the one who shows them.
        Start now. Build your AI SaaS empire. We'll handle the tech. You drive the growth.
        This is how you scale your agency into the stratosphere. Don't miss out.''',
